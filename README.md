# YouMatter
### A standalone UU-Matter mod for Minecraft Forge. Why? Because it matters.
#### YouMatter is available for 1.12.2, 1.14.4 and 1.15.2. Check out the respective branches.

You know that fluid called "UU-Matter" from IndustrialCraft2, don't you? Well, here you have it as a standalone mod.
I added some quirks that make it slightly less overpowered, such as adding an extra requirement for producing U-Matter.
## Why?
ICÂ² is outdated, has many bugs and often is just included in modpacks because of its UU-Matter features. That was the inspiration for creating a standalone mod.

## Config
YouMatter's Config allows you to set a default required U-Matter amount for the duplication of items and set overrides for special items (e.g. set the required amount for stone lower than default or set it higher than default for diamonds)
In order to set the default amount, use the option `uMatterPerItem` and enter the amount in milibuckets. You can copy the format of the default overrides and change the name of the item and the amount on your own.
**As of version 1.3**, you can create a **Black- or Whitelist**. You have the option to add items to a list called `specialItems`. Using the option `useAsBlacklist` you can decide whether to allow or disallow the Items in `specialItems` to be duplicated.
